    We trained a classification model on data from the Berlin Open Data Portal, which covered 15 features (including
    number of residents, usetype, air pollution, green roof subsidy program eligbility, social inequality index).

    The model was then run on all blocks in Berlin that do not have a green roof as of yet to predict the probability that
    these have a green roof implemented. Knowing that these blocks are in fact empty, allows
    the interpretation that blocks with higher percentages are likely to still implement green roofs, and areas
    with lower percentages will need political and societal intervention, in order to make sure they will adapt as well.

    It is important to note that this is not a potential analysis of where green roofs _can_ be implemented. Seperate analyses
    have shown that the large majority of roofs in Berlin are suitable to carry green roofs.

    that contain green roofs for more than 15% of the building foot print area, highlighted in yellow color.

    Given that the distribution in this map is different from that of Air Pollution, it too, should be taken into account

    Areas with high thermal stress, high air pollution and low adaptation likelihood should be the focus of any further political climate change adaptation efforts in Berlin.
